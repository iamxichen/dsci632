## Abstract

In this study, we examine telemarketing practices for promoting long-term bank deposits to poten-tial bank customers. A number of machine learning algorithms, like Decision Tree (DT) and Logistic Regression (LR), were employed to determine the subscription of long-term bank deposits. The results confirm that the DT model provides an f1-score of 0.90 compared to LR, which has an f1-score of 0.73 for the positive class, making DT the better model for predicting the potential customers who have an interest in long-term deposits  through telemarketing. Notably, many financial services providers adopted telemarketing strategy to reach out tothe new customers and to provide better services to existing customers, and to meet their specific needs. In future marketing campaigns, the results of the machine learning model could be used by managers to prioritize and select which customers to contact next.
